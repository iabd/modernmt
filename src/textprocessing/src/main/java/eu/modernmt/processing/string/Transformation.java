/**
 * * Created by andrea on 22/02/17.
 * <p>
 * A Transformation is any kind of activity that an Editor can request
 * while scanning the StringBuilder current version of the string under analysis.
 * <p>
 * A Transformation has fields for each piece of information
 * that a single processing activity may need, such as:
 * - start index of the text to edit on the original string;
 * - end index of the text to edit on the original string;
 * - a string with the text to edit itself;
 * - a string with the new text that must replace replace the text to edit (optional);
 * - a reference to the TokenFactory that suits the transformation (Word, XMLTag, etc).
 * <p>
 * If a transformation does not involve replacement, the replacement field is null.
 * In general, word settings do not involve replacement.
 * <p>
 * If a transformation does not lead to token generation, its tokenFactory field is null.
 * In general, pure replacements do not lead to token generation.
 * <p>
 * In the tokenization process, each Editor creates its Transformations
 * and stores them in a list of its own.
 * When the Editor executes commit(), its transformation are sent to the SentenceBuilder.
 * When the SentenceBuilder builds the Sentence as a result of the tokenization process,
 * Transformation are used to generate the Sentence tokens.
